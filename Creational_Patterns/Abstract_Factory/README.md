# Abstract Factory

## Intent:
- Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- This pattern can be applied to objects only.

## When should "the Abstract Factory Pattern" be used?
- Use this pattern when your system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- Use this pattern when your system should be configured with one of multiple families of products which is designed to be used together.
- Use this pattern when you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to show just their interfaces, not their implementations.
