# Factory Method

## Intent:
- Factory Method is a creational design pattern that lets you provide an interface for creating objects in a base class, however allows subclasses to determine which class to instantiate. In other words, factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- This pattern can be applied to classes only.

## When should "the Factory Method Pattern" be used?
- Use this pattern when your class does not know or expect the class type of objects it must create.
- Use this pattern when your class wants its subclasses to determine the objects it creates.
- Use this pattern when your class wants to give responsibility to one of its subclasses.
