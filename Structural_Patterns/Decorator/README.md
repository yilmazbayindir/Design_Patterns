# Decorator

## Intent:
- Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach additional responsibilities to an object at runtime by placing these objects inside customized decorator objects that contain these extra responsibilities. 
- This pattern can be applied to objects only.

## When should "the Decorator Pattern" be used?
- Use this pattern when you want to assign extra responsibilities to an object at runtime without breaking/disturbing existing codes and other objects.
- Use this pattern when it is not possible or efficient solution to extend an objectâ€™s responsibility by subclassing via inheritance.
