# Proxy

## Intent:
- Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object in order to control access to it.
- This pattern can be applied to objects only.

## When should "the Proxy Pattern" be used?
- Use this pattern when you need to use a more sophisticated reference to an object than a simple pointer. 
- Use this pattern for several common situations such as "remote proxy", "virtual proxy", "protection proxy", "smart reference".
