# Composite

## Intent:
Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures in order to represent part-whole relationship. This pattern can be applied to objects only.

## When should "the Composite Pattern" be used?
- Use this pattern when you need to form a tree hierarchy for objects having part-whole relationship.
- Use this pattern when you want the client to treat both leaf and composite parts uniformly.
