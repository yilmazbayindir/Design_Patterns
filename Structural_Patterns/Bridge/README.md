# Bridge

## Intent:
- Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you decouple an abstraction from its implementation. In this way, they can be developed independently of each other.

## When and why should the Bridge Pattern be used?
- Use this pattern when you need to hide implementation details of an abstraction from clients.
- Use this pattern when you need to develop or change an implementation without disturbing the clients.
- Use this pattern when you want to avoid a permanent binding between abstractions and their implementations so that you can select or switch the desired implementation at runtime.
- Use this pattern when you want to extend your class hierarchy in several independent dimensions so that abstractions and their implementations can be extended by subclassing in related dimension.
