# Facade

## Intent:
- Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a single interface to a set of subsystem classes.
- It defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
- This pattern can be applied to objects only.

## When should "the Facade Pattern" be used?
- Use this pattern when you want to have a single and simple interface to a complex subsystem.
- Use this pattern to decouple a subsystem from client and other subsystems when there are several dependencies between client and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
- Use this pattern when you want to transform a subsystem into layers by using a facade as an entry point to each level.
