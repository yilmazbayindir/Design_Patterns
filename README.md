# Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven solutions to well-known problems in software world. They are like prefabricated schema that you can use to solve your problem in your system. Design patterns make it easier to reuse successful architectures. Documenting proven solutions as design patterns makes them more reachable to software design engineers having the same software design problems. In fact, they can develop the documentation of existing software systems. In brief, each design pattern characterizes a problem which occurs over and over again in software world, and then offers the solution to that problem.

In this repository, proven solutions as design patterns have been expressed with their description, object model diagram(OMD) of an example scenario and associated codes by using some popular programming languages such as C++, Python, Java.
