# Design Patterns

Design patterns make it easier to reuse successful designs and architectures. Expressing proven techniques as design patterns makes them more accessible to developers of new systems and also, help them choose design choices that make a system reusable. They can even develop the documentation and maintenance of existing systems. In brief, each design pattern chatacterizes a problem which occurs over and over again in real world, and then offers the solution to that problem.

In this repository, proven techniques as design patterns have been expressed with their description, object model diagram(OMD) of an example scenario and associated codes by using some popular programming languages such as C++, Python, Java.
